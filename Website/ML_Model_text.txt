Machine Learning

<br>If you have clicked on the "Talk to me!" button and made Michael speak to you, you would have just witnessed machine generated text at work. The words that appear to the right are generated by a TensorFlow Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Text Generation model trained with all of Michael's scripts from the entire show.</br>

<br>We scraped the website https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org for all scripts from "The Office", cleaned it, extracted Michael's lines, and fed it to the TensorFlow Keras model. Each character from Michael's lines are vectorized and re-joined back into strings. Next comes the exciting part - prediction! The RNN model attempts to calculate the probability of the next character, given what it has previously "seen". This is where training is crucial to what the model will predict.</br>

<br>Since we wanted to build a model that will speak like Michael, we only allowed it to see Michael's lines. We set it to train for 500 epochs but monitored the training to stop at the most optimal juncture, for us, this is at 151 epochs with a loss of 36% and an accuracy of 87.5%.</br>

<br>Once training is completed, the machine becomes prediction-ready. The words you type in the text box to the right seeds the model and it begins to predict text based on the probability of the next character. In a matter of split-seconds, sentences are formed.</br>

<br>As you would have noticed, this isn't a perfect model. Some words are not English and some sentences might not be coherent at all, but another thing you should have noticed is that it sure sounds like Michael!</br>
